  <h2>Introduction to the Dataset and Prediction Question</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset we are using focuses on <strong>major power outages</strong> across various regions. 
    It contains detailed records of outages, including the causes, durations, affected populations, 
    and geographic information. This dataset offers insights into the factors that contribute to 
    power outages and the severity of their impacts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our central question is: <em>"What causes most major power outages, and can we predict the most likely cause of an outage?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding the root causes of power outages and predicting them is crucial for improving power grid 
    reliability, preparing for natural disasters, and reducing the socioeconomic impacts of outages. Power outages 
    can disrupt daily life, damage economies, and threaten public safety. Utilities, policymakers, and researchers 
    can leverage insights from this analysis to better allocate resources, design preventative measures, and 
    strengthen infrastructure.
